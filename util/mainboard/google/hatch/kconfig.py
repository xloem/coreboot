"""Add a new variant to the Kconfig and Kconfig.name for the baseboard

To start a new variant of an existing baseboard, we need to add
the variant into the Kconfig and Kconfig.name files for the
baseboard. In Kconfig, we have two sections that need additional
entries, MAINBOARD_PART_NUMBER and VARIANT_DIR.

The MAINBOARD_PART_NUMBER and VARIANT_DIR just use various
capitalizations of the variant name to create the strings.

Kconfig.name adds an entire section for the new variant, and all
of these use various capitalizations of the variant name. The strings
in this section are SOC-specific, so we'll need versions for each
SOC that we support.
